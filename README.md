# Neural_Net_and_MoG_digit_classification
Neural Net and Mixture of Gaussian learning model experimentation. Used a dataset of drawings of 2 and 3 digits to experiment with the above 2 models, and gain familiarity with some paramteres, as well as  fine-tuning them, for better prediction abilities. Written in MATLAB.
